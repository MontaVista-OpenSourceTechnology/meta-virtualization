meta-virtualization
===================

This layer provides support for building Xen, KVM, Libvirt, and associated
packages necessary for constructing OE-based virtualized solutions.

The bbappend files for some recipes (e.g. linux-yocto) in this layer need to
have 'virtualization' in DISTRO_FEATURES to have effect. To enable them, add
in configuration file the following line.

  DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " virtualization"

If meta-virtualization is included, but virtualization is not enabled as a
distro feature a warning is printed at parse time:

    You have included the meta-virtualization layer, but
    'virtualization' has not been enabled in your DISTRO_FEATURES. Some bbappend files
    may not take effect. See the meta-virtualization README for details on enabling
    virtualization support.

If you know what you are doing, this warning can be disabled by setting the following
variable in your configuration:

  SKIP_META_VIRT_SANITY_CHECK = 1

Depending on your use case, there are other distro features in meta-virtualization
that may also be enabled:

 - xen: enables xen functionality in various packages (kernel, libvirt, etc)
 - kvm: enables KVM configurations in the kernel and autoloads modules
 - k8s: enables kubernets configurations in the kernel, tools and configuration
 - aufs: enables aufs support in docker and linux-yocto
 - x11: enable xen and libvirt functionality related to x11
 - selinux: enables functionality in libvirt and lxc
 - systemd: enable systemd services and unit files (for recipes for support)
 - sysvinit: enable sysvinit scripts (for recipes with support)
 - seccomp: enable seccomp support for packages that have the capability.

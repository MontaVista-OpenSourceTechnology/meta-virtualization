meta-virtualization
===================

The meta-virtualization layer is the authoritative resource for virtualization
technologies in OpenEmbedded / Yocto built distributions.  It provides support
or both hypervisor-based virtualization (such as KVM, Xen, and QEMU) and
system-level virtualization (Linux containers), along with the host and guest
technologies required to build complete solutions ranging from embedded systems
to full deep CNCF stack deployments.

The bbappend files for some recipes (e.g. linux-yocto) in this layer need to
have 'virtualization' in DISTRO_FEATURES to have effect. To enable them, add
in configuration file the following line.

  DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " virtualization"

If meta-virtualization is included, but virtualization is not enabled as a
distro feature a warning is printed at parse time:

    You have included the meta-virtualization layer, but
    'virtualization' has not been enabled in your DISTRO_FEATURES. Some bbappend files
    may not take effect. See the meta-virtualization README for details on enabling
    virtualization support.

If you know what you are doing, this warning can be disabled by setting the following
variable in your configuration:

  SKIP_META_VIRT_SANITY_CHECK = 1

Depending on your use case, there are other distro features in meta-virtualization
that may also be enabled:

 - xen: enables xen functionality in various packages (kernel, libvirt, etc)
 - kvm: enables KVM configurations in the kernel and autoloads modules
 - k8s: enables kubernetes configurations in the kernel, tools and configuration
 - aufs: enables aufs support in docker and linux-yocto
 - x11: enable xen and libvirt functionality related to x11
 - selinux: enables functionality in libvirt and lxc
 - systemd: enable systemd services and unit files (for recipes for support)
 - sysvinit: enable sysvinit scripts (for recipes with support)
 - seccomp: enable seccomp support for packages that have the capability.

# Install Let's Encrypt intermediate certificates (E8/ECDSA, R11/RSA).
#
# Only active when 'virtualization' is in DISTRO_FEATURES.
#
# Some container registries (e.g., registry.yocto.io) don't send the
# full certificate chain. Go's TLS library (used by Docker, skopeo,
# podman) cannot verify the server certificate without the intermediate,
# even though the root CAs (ISRG Root X1/X2) are present.
#
# These intermediates are fetched at build time and installed alongside
# the standard CA certificates. update-ca-certificates (run in
# pkg_postinst) incorporates them into the system CA bundle.

Subject: [PATCH] s3-aws: fix build for 386

When building for 386, we got the following build error:

  registry/storage/driver/s3-aws/s3.go:312:99: cannot use
  maxChunkSize (untyped int constant 5368709120) as int value
  in argument to getParameterAsInteger (overflows)

This is because the s3_64bit.go is used. Adjust the build tag matching
in s3_32bit.go and s3_64bit.go to fix this issue.

Upstream-Status: Submitted [https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4642]
